Software is meant to be used by people, not just locked down by security policies. This presentation explores how we can establish trust in our software supply chain while keeping developers productive and happy.

Using Red Hat's implementation with Tekton and Tekton Chains, we'll demonstrate a progressive trust model that starts with basic K8s + Tekton foundations and builds up through community-contributed trusted tasks, tamper-proof data flows, independent SLSA provenance generation, automated policy guidance, and finally a "build once, release everywhere" service.

The key insight: instead of blocking developers with rigid security controls, we can create systems that guide them toward secure practices while preserving their autonomy and creativity.

## Core Themes

1. **Developer Experience First** - Security should enable, not hinder
2. **Progressive Trust Building** - Layer security incrementally
3. **Community Contribution** - Shared responsibility and knowledge
4. **Policy as Guidance** - Violations inform rather than block
5. **Tamper-Proof Workflows** - Technical guarantees without friction

## Technical Components

- **Foundation:** Kubernetes + Tekton pipeline platform
- **Task Library:** Community-verified, reusable build components
- **Artifact Security:** Cryptographic signing and attestation
- **Provenance Generation:** Automatic SLSA compliance via Tekton Chains
- **Policy Engine:** Conforma-based guidance and requirements checking
- **Release Service:** Multi-environment deployment orchestration

## Key Takeaways

1. **Trust can be built progressively** without sacrificing developer experience
2. **Community contribution** scales security knowledge and reduces individual burden
3. **Policy violations** are opportunities for education, not roadblocks
4. **Technical guarantees** (signing, attestation) provide security without friction
5. **Developer autonomy** and security compliance can coexist
